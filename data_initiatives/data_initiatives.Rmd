# Prework

This is a resource to get prepared for the "Modern Information Workflows" workshop using R and Rstudio workshop that will be done on {INSERT DATE}. In order for the workshop to go smoothly and, more importantly, for you to get something out of it, you'll need to do a few things to get setup. If you have any questions during prework, please contact one of us at the following emails:

* D. Cale Reeves: [d.cale.reeves@utexas.edu](mailto:d.cale.reeves@utexas.edu)
* Noorah Alhasan: [noorah.alhasan@utexas.edu](mailto:noorah.alhasan@utexas.edu)
* Matt Worthington: [matthew.worthington@austin.utexas.edu](matthew.worthington@austin.utexas.edu)

## About The Workshop

In both professional work and in academic settings, projects are getting bigger, analyses are becoming more complex, and there is increasing demand for attractive and interactive content. Meeting the appetite for projects that do more and reach further than ever before places heavy demands on a project’s workflow. In this series, we demonstrate a modern workflow that uses simple building blocks to turn high-quality analytics into memos, papers, presentations, and even web pages – and it’s easy to do. Even participants that have never written a line of code will create and host a webpage in the first session. 

Constructed from easily accessed free services, this example workflow is designed from the ground-up to support teamwork, transparency, replicability, and a broad range of deliverables. We’ll show you how to recycle the same basic techniques to co-create products that are both tailored to the target audience and replicable by the world at-large.

## Get Set up with Github

While I know this is a workshop whose title is all about R, the very first thing you'll need to do is get your computer setup to work with Github. Follow these steps to get setup with Github. 


* **First, create a Github account:** Go to [github.com](http://github.com) and sign-up for an account. You'll need this account for the next step and for use in the workshop.

* **Next, download the Github desktop client:** Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) and download the client for your platform. Once downloaded, make sure you open and log into the app with the account you created.
