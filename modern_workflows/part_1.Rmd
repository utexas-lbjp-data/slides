## About this session

We will explore how to navigate Github and Rstudio as ecosystems and establish a basic workflow that includes an interaction between the two systems with a static webpage as a final product.


---

In this session we will be adopting the following workflow (of so so many):

![Workflow](assets/images/Workflow.jpg)

Disclaimer: This workflow places strong emphasis on RStudio in terms of content creation, whereas Github is mainly used for product sharing.

---

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub account
2. GitHub desktop app
3. RStudio (cloud/desktop)
4. Local computer has the following programming languages installed:
  1. R
  2. Git


---

## What is Git?

- Git is a version control programming language.
  - Version control: think of it as Google doc history
  - Repository: think of it as a folder on your computer.

## What is GitHub?

- GitHub is an online hosting provider that is based on Git

## What is GitHub Pages?

- Webpages that are created directly from your git repository that is hosted in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Creating a project

- Most of the time when we are creating a new project, we open a new file (Word, Excel, Google doc, etc.) on our computer (local machine to be fancy) and start creating right way.
- In this workshop, we want to show you a more systematic way of creating and engaging with a project that consists of many elements.
- Taking a step back, instead of opening a new file to start creating your product, you create a folder for that product.

- That's where R Projects and Github repositories come in.

- There are several ways to create an R Project:

  1. As a brand new folder (aka directory) on your computer
  2. From an existing directory on you local machine
  3. From a remote repository (a previously created Github repository)
  
- For this session we will go with step 3
