## About The Workshop

In both professional work and in academic settings, projects are getting bigger, analyses are becoming more complex, and there is increasing demand for attractive and interactive content. Meeting the appetite for projects that do more and reach further than ever before places heavy demands on a project’s workflow. In this series, we demonstrate a modern workflow that uses simple building blocks to turn high-quality analytics into memos, papers, presentations, and even web pages – and it’s easy to do. Even participants that have never written a line of code will create and host a webpage in the first session. 

Constructed from easily accessed free services, this example workflow is designed from the ground-up to support teamwork, transparency, replicability, and a broad range of deliverables. We’ll show you how to recycle the same basic techniques to co-create products that are both tailored to the target audience and replicable by the world at-large.

## Get Set up with Github

While I know this is a workshop whose title is all about R, the very first thing you'll need to do is get your computer setup to work with Github. Follow these steps to get setup with Github. 


* **First, create a Github account:** Go to [github.com](http://github.com) and sign-up for an account. You'll need this account for the next step and for use in the workshop.

* **Next, download the Github desktop client:** Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) and download the client for your platform. Once downloaded, make sure you open and log into the app with the account you created. 

* **Finally**: GitHub desktop will also ask you to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine. Please follow the directions on the webpage.

## Ways To Use R For This Workshop

The next and last step to get ready for the workshop is to get setup with an RStudio environment. Fortunately, there are two ways to do this---both are relatively straightforward, but one requires a little extra work. Below is a comparison of using RStudio Cloud versus setting it up on your laptop or desktop computer. <span style='font-size: 1em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #005f86;'><i class='fal fa-medal'></i></span> indicates the setup method with an advantage. <span style='font-size: 1em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #bf5700;'><i class='fal fa-tools'></i></span> indicates the setup method that works perfect, but requires a bit more work.

<div class="gt_center">
```{r echo=FALSE}

tibble(type = c("Setup","Ease of Use", "Speed", "Customization"),
       cloud = c("<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #005f86;'><i class='fal fa-medal'></i></span>",
                 "<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #005f86;'><i class='fal fa-medal'></i></span>",
                 "<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #bf5700;'><i class='fal fa-tools'></i></span>",
                 "<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #bf5700;'><i class='fal fa-tools'></i></span>"),
       desktop = c("<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #bf5700;'><i class='fal fa-tools'></i></span>",
                   "<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #bf5700;'><i class='fal fa-tools'></i></span>",
                   "<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #005f86;'><i class='fal fa-medal'></i></span>",
                   "<span style='font-size: 3em; display: inline-block;text-align: center; color: #005f86;'><i class='fal fa-medal'></i></span>")) %>%

  cols_width(vars(type) ~ px(175)) %>% 
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_text(weight = "bold", align = "center", color = "#333f48")),
    locations = cells_body(columns = vars(type))
    ) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_text(weight = "500", align = "center", color = "#333f48")),
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = vars(cloud, desktop))
    ) %>%
  tab_options(table.width = "950px",
              table.font.size = "18px",

              row.striping.background_color = "#ffffff",

## RStudio Cloud Setup

The easiest method to get started with RStudio + R is to use RStudio.Cloud, which is a new service for using R that the RStudio team provides. 

.pull-left.b--gray.ba.bw2.ma2.pa4.shadow-1[

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Step 1:** In a web browser, go to [rstudio.cloud](http://rstudio.cloud)  

**Step 2:** Log into it with the github account you created earlier.  

**Step 3:** Congrats! You're ready!

.pull-right[ 

**Benefits of using RStudio.cloud:** virtually no setup is required on your part other than logging in. If you use RStudio's cloud product, you're almost guaranteed to have every task or piece of code we ask you to use work perfectly.

**Drawback of using RStudio.cloud:** while the cloud setup is an easier method, the speed of the cloud application isn't as fast as the next method--local setup--nor does it offer the same level of flexibility. The occasions in which this will matter to you will likely come after the workshop, but it's something to consider.

### RStudio Desktop Setup

The next method to get started with RStudio is by setting up RStudio locally on your desktop. Until recently, this was the only free option for most users to use RStudio, so despite some drawbacks, this method is tried and true. 

.pull-left.b--gray.ba.bw2.ma2.pa4.shadow-1[

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Step 1:** Go to [this link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).  

**Step 2:** Follow the two-step instructions on that page. 

**Step 3:** For visual assistance, use the video tutorial on the right. 

**Step 4:** Congrats, you're ready!

.panel[.panel-name[Benefits and Drawbacks]

**Benefits of using RStudio Desktop:** Setting up RStudio locally on your desktop is beneficial for a number of reasons, but mostly because it allows you to customize your RStudio environment to your liking. Another good reason for using RStudio locally is that it's faster for most tasks.

**Drawback of using RStudio Desktop:** while the desktop setup is preferred for many users, it does require more effort on the initial setup than using RStudio Cloud. Also, in more rare cases, certain packages may require additional setup that can be complicated. While those cases don't impact this workshop, down the road in your coding journey, you may bump up against that.
