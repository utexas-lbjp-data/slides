# Prework

This is a resource to get prepared for Dr. Abner's Public Management class using R and Rstudio. In order for the workshop to go smoothly and, more importantly, for you to get something out of it, you'll need to do a few things to get setup. If you have any questions during prework, please contact one of us at the following emails before class:

* Matt Worthington: [matthew.worthington@austin.utexas.edu](matthew.worthington@austin.utexas.edu)

#### Class Workshop Dates:

* Public Management: Sep 1, 2021
* Public Management: Sep 13, 2021

## About The Workshop

Whether you're conducting a comprehensive program evaluation, making some clean charts and maps, or working to build a sophisticated statistical model, the tools inside [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) make policy work incredibly efficient *and* reproducible. While this workshop is designed to help you get started in R as a policy student, *getting good at R takes practice*. The good news, we're giving you a framework that will make your learning easier and more beneficial over time (both at LBJ and after graduation).

### Task 2: Learning Markdown 

If you're not familiar with Markdown, that's okay. If you're like me, you grew up using things like Microsoft Office and Google Docs to write, so you're probably not familiar with markdown, but Markdown is a lot easier. So... what is it? 

Markdown is just an easy way to write formatted text.  Like anything else, it takes practice, but is used widely in popular writing apps like [Bear](https://bear.app), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app). For the purposes of this workshop, we'll use it in an RStudio document tool called "[Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)". Here's a quick way to get familiar with writing in Markdown:

.bg--burntorange.b--text-color.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5.f7[
*__Note__: If writing in Markdown still feels weird, don't worry. I'll also show you some tricks inside RStudio to make writing easier. Just make sure to do this tutorial.*

* **First, visit this link:** Go to [https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)  
* **Then, do the 10-minute tutorial:** It's a bit of time, but goes quick and will help you have a better grasp on writing in markdown by the time we start the workshop.
* **Finally, bookmark this site**: [https://commonmark.org/help/](https://commonmark.org/help/)

### Task 3: Install Workshop Packages

We'll need a few packages during the workshop, so try installing these. If you have trouble, shoot me an email at [matthew.worthington@austin.utexas.edu](matthew.worthington@austin.utexas.edu):

* **Step one:** Open RStudio after you've installed it.
* **Step two:** Paste the code below in your console (see screenshot)

```r
install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "tidycensus", "distill"))
```
